# Fair-Lloyd-algorithm
Matlab implementation of the Fair-Lloyd algorithm. Description of the files:

Folder: Fair-Lloyd

	a.	load and pre-rpocess the data

	•	loadData: load the working dataset
	•	preProcessEductaionVector: only for the credit dataset. Outputs the sensitive feature vector indicating higher-educated and lower-educated
	•	normalizeData : make the mean 0 and variance one for each feature
	•	projectData: project the data using PCA or Fair-PCA
	•	fairPCA: project the data using the Fair-PCA algorithm of Samadi et al. 2018 (look below for subroutines)
	•	mw (subroutine for fairPCA): multiplicative weight update
	•	optApprox (subroutine for mw): finds the optimal rank-d approximation of a given matrix
	•	re (subroutine for mw): calculates reconstruction error of a matrix

	b.	Fair-Lloyd


	•	lloyd: implementation of lloyd’s and Fair-Lloyd algorithm (look below for subroutines)
	•	giveRandCenters: generate initial random centres
	•	findCenters: given a clustering, find the centers
	•	findClustering: given a set of centers, find the clustering
	•	compCost: given a clustering of the data, computing (fair) cost
	•	kmeansCost_S_C (subroutine for compCost): given a clustering and a set of centers, calculate the k-means cost. 
	•	bSearch: binary search procedure to find the fair centers

	c.	evaluate the results using lloyd’s and Fair-Lloyd

	•	maink: main file for running the experiments

Folder: plotsCode

	•	plotting the results using the output data by Fair-Lloyd and Lloyd’s
